# shift-cipher

This website allows you to encrypt your text using a [shift cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), also known as Caesar's code or cipher. Enter the text you want to encrypt, choose the shift amount, and select the direction of encryption (forwards or backwards). Once you submit the form, the encrypted text will be displayed below. You can use this tool to have fun with encoding and decoding secret messages.

**Note: Please refrain from using this tool to encrypt personal data or sensitive information. The shift cipher is NOT secure and can be easily broken, EVEN IF you change the shift to a different number. It is recommended to use a more modern form of encryption for secure communication.**

## Usage

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the text field.
2. Provide the desired shift amount in the shift field.
3. Choose the direction of encryption (forwards or backwards) from the dropdown menu.
4. Click the "Encrypt Text" button to perform the encryption.
5. The encrypted text will be displayed in the "Encrypted Text" section.
